## CMU Graphics

CMU Graphics is a persistent-object graphics package geared towards beginner computer science students. CMU Graphics and its desktop version are maintained by [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/), a Carnegie Mellon University project which develops free-to-use middle and high school computer science curriculum.

### Creating Your Repl

Click "Use Template" to create a new repl with CMU Graphics installed. If you're already in a repl, keep reading!

### Getting Started

To write animations using CMU Graphics, include the following line at the top of your Python file:

```python3
from cmu_graphics import *
```

At the end of your Python file, add this line:

```python3
cmu_graphics.run()
```

From there, the syntax for using the graphics package is identical to the browser-based version of the framework. You can find more details about how to use the graphics framework here on our [documentation page](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs).

### Need Some Inspiration?

This template includes 11 different sample programs under the `samples` folder for you to explore. To run a file:

1. Copy the code from a sample file into `main.py`
2. Click "Run" to start the animation.
3. Follow the instructions at the top of the file

### Have fun!
